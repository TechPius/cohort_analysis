# Cohort Analysis
Cohort analysis involves dividing users into distinct groups or cohorts based on certain criteria. In this case study, theses cohorts are defined by the time of user acquisition by grouping users together based on time of acquisition. we can study how different cohorts behave in terms of engagement and retention

## Cohort Analysis Example
You might create cohorts based on the month users first signed up for your service. You can then track how each cohorts activity such as their conversion rate or lifetime value evolves over time. This approach allows you to identify trends, anomalies and areas where you may need to makeadjustments to improve user retention and satisfaction.

## Retention Rate Time-Based Cohort Analysis:


*   create cohorts based on user acquisition dates
*   Measure the percentage of users from each cohort who  continue to engage with your product or serviceover time (e.g after 1 month, 3 months etc)

*   Analyse how retention rates vary across differentcohortsand time periods enabling you to identify trends and make data driven decisions
This Analysis can reveal whether certain cohorts have better or worse retention rates, helping the business understand the factors contributiongto user retention or attention. it can also assist in optimizing marketing, product development and customer support strategies
